# Valant-InvTool
API to support Inventory operations


Requirements:
Please design, and code, an inventory system. Please do the following:


- Design and implement API layer to model and support the below requirements. You do not need to develop a UI, unless it helps you.

- Provide a README file with  

●        Instructions on how to run your application. 

●        Brief documentation about your design, code structure, any notes you want to add for extensibility, maintainability, security, performance, etc., that you don't have time to implement.

●        Brief documentation about assumptions, reasoning, features you’ve altered and why.

- Write production-quality code and provide a runnable solution (at least from tests as entry points)

●        In memory data structure is okay (no database code needed)

●        Document the trade-offs you’re making.  We’re going to review this as if you wrote it for production.  If you don’t mention a trade-off, we may assume it’s due to your experience level.
 e.g. “This is how I would handle security.  I didn’t include it in the code because it would have taken an extra hour.”

●        Write tests
